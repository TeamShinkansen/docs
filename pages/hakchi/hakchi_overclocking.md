## Overclocking

### Overclock options  
While overclocking your machine **MAY** become unstable and crash.  This is due to the quality of the manufactured CPU.  If you experience crashing please disable any overclocking.

The **preferred method** of overclocking  is Easy Overclock.
Easy overclock from the Modules > KMFD's Mod hub > Games (tab).  When sync'd this "Game" is added to the UI menu to allow toggling  of overclock.  
NOTE: Resets after power cycle  

**Other but not preferred  methods.**
Xtreme overclock is always active and can be found in Modules > KMFD's Mod hub > KMFD RetroArch (tab) > Xtreme Overclock  
    NOTE: Can be verified  and toggled via telnet.  Stock freq - 1008000, Overclock freq - 1344000.  
       - hakchi overclock - Display current speed and temp  
       - hakchi overclock boot - Set default clock speed  
       - hakchi overclock max - Enables overclock  

    NOTE: Maintains after power cycle  

If --overclock is added to the command line of a RetroArch game the system will overclock for game then down clock on exit
